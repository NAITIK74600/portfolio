# Certificate Images

Place your certificate images in this folder with the following names:
- ml-specialization.jpg
- fullstack-web.jpg
- aws-cloud.jpg
- data-science.jpg
- react-complete.jpg
- advanced-css.jpg
- docker-k8s.jpg
- python-ai.jpg
- git-github.jpg

Or update the image paths in `/data/certificates.js` to match your actual certificate filenames.

## Image Guidelines
- Format: JPG, PNG, or WebP
- Resolution: Minimum 1200x900 pixels for best quality
- Aspect Ratio: 16:11 or similar landscape orientation
- File Size: Under 500KB (optimized for web)

## Alternative Options
If you don't have certificate images yet:
1. The component will show a badge icon as placeholder
2. You can use screenshots of your actual certificates
3. You can use certificate preview images from course platforms
4. Leave the image field as is - the design handles missing images gracefully
